# Cucumber-Rails Training Wheels

Cucumber-Rails Training Wheels contains a couple of generators to get you started with Cucumber and Rails quickly. If you don't take them off immediately you will end up with a complete mess. -And remember - every time you run a Cucumber feature based on Cucumber-Rails Training Wheels, god kills a kitten.

You have been warned. You can read more about what you can do instead here:

## Installation

Add this to your Gemfile

    gem 'cucumber-training-wheels'

## Pull requests

Please don't bother. This gem exists for the sole purpose of helping people who are reading books or blogs that were written prior to Cucumber-Rails 1.1.0. I really want this code to go away and be forgotten.

If something is broken, just fork it and use your own fork.
