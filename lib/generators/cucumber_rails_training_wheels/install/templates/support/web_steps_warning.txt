# TL;DR: YOU SHOULD DELETE THIS FILE
#
# This file was generated by Cucumber-Rails and is only here to get you a head start
# These step definitions are thin wrappers around the Capybara/Webrat API that lets you
# visit pages, interact with widgets and make assertions about page content.
#
# If you use these step definitions as basis for your features you will quickly end up
# with features that are:
#
# * Hard to maintain
# * Verbose to read
#
# A much better approach is to write your own higher level step definitions, following
# the advice in the following blog posts:
